# ML-project-diabetes-
Hi there,
This is my first mini-project on github
The mini-project helps us to predict the chances of person having diabetes.
It uses datasets glucose level,mass,age and more of them mentioned in csv file.
By applying Machine Learning algorithm(KNN-classifier), training and testing the dataset I got 75% of accuracy in test data.
